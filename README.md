The RSA algorithem (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a well know public key cryptography system that's commonly used in message encrytion and digital signature.
Due to the development of quantom computers the trustworthiness of the RSA is threatend. Becasue of the higher computational capabilities that quantum computers are able to achive
it's therefor theorized that the Factorization Problem, the main reason for the RSA's safety, becomes solvable in human time frames. Our project involves applying the RSA protocol 
onto a new group, the Thompson's group. This group, which is charaterized with cryptographic properties, will serve as a new base for the RSA public-key encrytion syetem and will also
provide an encryption and dycrytion method that is secure for Information Exchange, communication and data sharing.

As it is the early stages no finalized code is provided yet.
